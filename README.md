# REST API in Go with Gorilla

This is the beginning of my project for the Independent Study portion of the WDI at Galvanize. I chose to build an API in a new language, choosing [Go](http://golang.org) for its reputation among the web development community for being a fast, powerful, flexible language.  

This is a toy REST API with todo routes and user auth. I learned a lot building this API and plan to now take it and turn it into a fully fledged backend for a different project, Askify v2.
